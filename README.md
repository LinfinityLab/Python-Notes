# Python-Notes
Some notes from book I read


Learning Python - by Mark Lutz
==============================
- Python is dynamic typing, it defines the types during runtime, eg. 

  ```python
  number = 3 # it makes varibale number be integer 3
  ```
- Python's variables are just names that can reference objects, difference variables can reference to the same object, eg.     
  ```python
  number = 3 # it makes varibale number be integer 3
  x = number # x is now 3 and it reference to the same object 3 as number reference to
  ```
